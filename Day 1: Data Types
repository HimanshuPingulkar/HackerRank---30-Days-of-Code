Day 1: Data Types

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer that you must sum with i.
The second line contains a double that you must sum with d.
The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with s.

Output Format:
Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles (scaled to 1 decimal place) on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.

CODE:

i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.

# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
j = int(input())
e = float(input())
t = input()
# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i+j)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d+e)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
print(s+t)
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
